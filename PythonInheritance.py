# Python Inheritance.
# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# Create a Parent Class.
# Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method :
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname
  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method :
x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

# Create a Child Class.
# Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class :
class Student(Person):
  pass

# Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method :
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
